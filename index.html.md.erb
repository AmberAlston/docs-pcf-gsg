Welcome to Pivotal Cloud Foundry!

This guide is intended to walk you through deploying the installation virtual
machine known as Ops Manager, configuring the IaaS settings, installing PCF
Elastic Runtime, and pushing your first app.

If you experience a problem while following the steps below, check the [Known Issues](../pcf-release-notes/index.html), or refer to the [PCF Troubleshooting Guide](../customizing/troubleshooting.html).
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.pivotal.io](http://docs.pivotal.io) to learn more about [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) (PCF)
and the Pivotal product suite.

## <a id='system'></a>Step 1: Confirm System Requirements ##

Before you begin your PCF deployment, ensure that your system meets the
minimum requirements.
The requirements include capacity for the virtual machines necessary for the
deployment, a supported version of the cf command line interface tool, and
certain user privileges.
Refer to the [Prerequisites to Deploying Operations Manager and Elastic Runtime](../customizing/requirements.html) topic for the complete list.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy PCF Installation Virtual Appliance ##

The PCF Installation Virtual Appliance is known as Ops Manager.
Log in to [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) and download the Ops
Manager virtual appliance file that matches your infrastructure.

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: For AWS, the Ops Manager virtual
appliance file is a PDF containing a reference to an Amazon Machine Identifier
(AMI).</p>

Deploy Ops Manager using the procedure that corresponds to the IaaS that you
use:

* [Deploying Operations Manager to vSphere](../customizing/deploying-vm.html)
* [Deploying Operations Manager to vCloud Air and vCloud](../customizing/pcf-vchs-vcloud.html)
* [Deploying Ops Manager Director on AWS CloudFormation](../customizing/cloudform-om-deploy.html)
* [Deploying Operations Manager to OpenStack](../customizing/openstack.html)

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 3: Configure and Install PCF ##

**Goal**: Configure and install Ops Manager Director (included), Elastic
Runtime, and MySQL for PCF.
Skip the import steps for Elastic Runtime or MySQL for PCF if you do not
want to import these products.

1. Browse to the interface IP address that you specified in Step 2.

    <%= image_tag("guide/pivotal-cf.png") %>

1. Create a **User name** and **Password** and log in to access the interface.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On your first login attempt, an error
	message that the connection is untrusted appears because you are attempting
	to connect securely to a website with a self-signed certificate. Add Ops
	Manager as an exception to bypass this message on subsequent logins. </p>

### <a id='import-tiles'></a>Import Products ###

1. Download Elastic Runtime and MySQL for PCF at [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io).
    * Elastic Runtime: Click the **Pivotal Cloud Foundry** banner to access the PCF
		product page. Use the drop-down menu to select an Elastic Runtime
		release.
    * MySQL for PCF: Select the **All Products** tab to view available
		products. Search for "MySQL for PCF" and select a release.

### <a id='configure-vmware'></a>Configure Ops Manager Director ###

Your Ops Manager download includes a tile for the version of Ops Manager
Director that corresponds to your IaaS.
Refer to one of the following topics for help configuring your Ops Manager
Director product tile:

* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html)
* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for vCloud Air and vCloud](../customizing/vchs-vcloud-config.html)
* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for Amazon Web Services](../customizing/pcf-aws-om-config.html)

### <a id='configure-er'></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

Refer to one of the following topics for help configuring Elastic Runtime:

* [Configuring Elastic Runtime for AWS](../customizing/pcf-aws-er-config.html)
* [Configuring Elastic Runtime for vSphere and VCloud Air](../customizing/config-er-vmware.html)

### <a id='configure-mysql'></a>Configure MySQL ###

1. Click the **MySQL Dev** tile.

1. Configure the MySQL Service Plan, Lifecycle Errands, and resource sizes.
Assign Availability Zones and an Ops Manager network, then click **Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='install'></a>Install Products ###

1. Click **Install**.

     <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated PCF installation begins deploying.

     <%= image_tag("guide/deploy-progress.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

     <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On the recommended hardware
	infrastructure, deployment should take less than one hour and require no
	user intervention.</p>

You now have a fully functional installation of PCF and Pivotal MySQL
Service.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 4: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed PCF, add users to your account.
Refer to the [Creating New Elastic Runtime User Accounts](../customizing/creating-account.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 5: Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf CLI tool to target your Elastic Runtime
installation.
Make sure that you have [installed the cf CLI tool](../devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html).
Refer to the PCF documentation for more information about [using the cf
command line tool](../devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In Pivotal Ops Manager, refer to
	<strong>Elastic Runtime > Credentials</strong> for the UAA admin name and
	password. You can also use the user that you created in Apps Manager, or
	create another user with the <code>create-user</code> command.</p>
