1. (**Understanding SSL termination options**) SSL termination is turned on by default. You can use the Pivotal-deployed HAProxy load balancer for SSL termination, or you can use a load balancer that you provide. The SSL termination method you select determines whether certain fields in the Elastic Runtime configuration are required. The table below helps you understand which steps are required for your SSL termination method. Steps 11-15 and step 17 walk you through configuring these fields.

  <table border="1" class="table" >
  <tr><th></th><th><strong>Pivotal-Deployed HAProxy Load Balancer (Default)</strong></th><th><strong>Other Load Balancer</strong></th></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>HAProxy IPs field</strong> (HAProxy page)</td><td><strong>REQUIRED</strong>. Enter the IP address(es) for HAProxy. You must point your DNS to this IP. HAProxy's IP must be in your subnet.</td><td>Unnecessary; leave blank.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>SSL Certificate field</strong> (HAProxy page)</td><td><strong>REQUIRED</strong>. If you are using a signed certificate from a well-known certificate authority (CA), you can import it. Alternatively, click <strong>Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate</strong> and follow the instructions in the next step.</td><td><strong>REQUIRED</strong>. If you are using a signed certificate from a well-known certificate authority (CA), you can import it. Alternatively, click <strong>Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate</strong> and follow the instructions in the next step.</td></tr>
  <tr><td><strong>Router IPs field</strong> (Router page)</td><td>Leave this field blank. HAProxy assigns the router IPs internally.</td><td><strong>REQUIRED</strong>. Enter the static IP(s) for Pivotal CF that you have registered previously with your load balancer.</td></tr>
  </table>

1. Enter at least one HAProxy IP address. You must point your DNS to this IP unless you are using your own load balancer. If you decide to use your own load balancer, leave this field blank.

  <%= image_tag("guide/haproxy.png") %>

 **Note:** Verify that your DNS resolves to the HAproxy IP address, as in the following example:

 <pre>
	# in this example, 88.198.254.170 is the HAproxy IP and example.com is both the system and app domain
	$ host example.com

	example.com has address 88.198.254.170
	example.com mail is handled by 0 smtp.secureserver.net.
	example.com mail is handled by 10 mailstore1.secureserver.net.

 </pre>

1. SSL certificates: If you are using a signed certificate from a well-known certificate authority (CA), input that value in the fields below. Alternatively, complete the following two steps to generate self-signed RSA certificates.

 <%= image_tag("guide/ssl.png") %>

1. Click **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate**.

1. Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format, as well as optionally any custom domains, also in wildcard format if necessary. Then, click **Save**. Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Cloud Controller** for explanations of these domain values.

    <%= image_tag("guide/rsa_cert.png") %>

1. The **Private Key PEM** and **Certificate Key PEM** fields now contain certificate keys. Click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/filled_haprox.png") %>

1. Enter two domains for your Cloud Controller installation and click **Save**. The system domain is used to target and push apps to Elastic Runtime. The application domain is used to serve apps. You configured wildcard DNS records for these domains in step 14.

 <%= image_tag("guide/cloud_cont.png") %>

1. If you are using HAProxy, you may leave the **Router IPs** field blank. Alternatively, if you are not using HAProxy and you are using your own load balancer, select **Router IPs** and enter the static IP(s) for Pivotal CF that you have registered previously with your load balancer.

 <%= image_tag("guide/router.png") %>

1. **(Optional--Advanced)** If you are using the vmware SSO appliance for integration with Active Directory, complete this step. Select **SAML Login** and enter the URL of an SSO appliance to connect to Active Directory servers in your organization.

 <%= image_tag("guide/saml_login.png") %>

1. **(Optional)** Select **Web Console**, enter your reply-to and SMTP email information, and click **Save**. The console uses these settings to send invitations and confirmations to console users. These SMTP settings are required if you want to enable end-user self-registration.

 **Note**: If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the administrator will be required to create orgs and users using the cf CLI tool. Refer to the section on [Creating a New User Account](#new-users) for more information.

 <%= image_tag("guide/console.png") %>

1. Select **Resource Sizes**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes, and click **Save**.

1. Click **Product Dashboard** to exit the configuration wizard.

1. Click **Add a new product**.

1. Under MySQL Dev, click **Add**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/pill_mysql.png") %>

1. Configure the MySQL resource sizes or keep the default values, then click **Product Dashboard** to exit the configuration wizard.

1. Click **Install**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated Pivotal CF installation begins deploying.

 <%= image_tag("guide/deploy_prog.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

 <%= image_tag("guide/deploy_success.png") %>

 **Note**: On the recommended hardware infrastructure, deployment should take less that one hour and require no user intervention.

You now have a fully functional installation of Pivotal CF and Pivotal MySQL Service. The following sections will help you start using your PaaS.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Creating a New User Account ##

Once you have successfully deployed Pivotal CF, complete one of the following workflows to add users to your account.

### <a id='smtp'></a>Option 1: Adding new users if you have enabled SMTP ###

The Developer Console is a self-service tool to help manage organizations, users, applications, and application spaces. If you have set up SMTP, your users can access the Developer Console to sign up for accounts and create their own orgs.

Instruct users to complete the following steps to log in and get started using the Developer Console.

1. Browse to `console.<your-app-domain>`. Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Cloud Controller** to locate your app domain.

1. Select **Create an Account**.

1. Enter your email address and click **Create an Account**. You will receive an email from the Developer Console when your account is ready.

1. When you receive the new account email, follow the link in the email to complete your registration.

1. You will be asked to choose your organization name.

You now have access to the Developer Console. Refer to the Pivotal CF Developer Console documentation at [docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) for more information about using the Developer Console.

### <a id='admin'></a>Option 2: Adding new users as admin ###

If you have not set up SMTP, the admin must create an organization and assign new users. This workflow is not self-service for users. Complete the following steps to log in and invite new users using the cf CLI tool.

1. If you have not already installed the cf CLI tool, browse to the Developer Console at `console.<your-app-domain>` and navigate to the **Tools** page. This page prompts you to select your operating system and provides the appropriate instructions for installing the cf CLI tool.

1. Log in using the UAA administrator user credentials. Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Credentials** for this login information, located about halfway down the page. If you do not supply required options on the command line, cf will prompt for them.

  ```
  $ cf target https://api.<your-sys-domain>
  $ cf login admin
  ...
  ```
1. You must create a new org for new users or select an existing org for them to join. To create a new org, run:

 ```
 $ cf create-org [org-name]
 ```

1. Create a new user and specify the org the user should join.

  ```
  $ cf create-user [user-email] -o [org-name]

  ```

1. cf prompts you for the password for the new user.

1. Give the new user the Developer Console address and their new credentials. The user now has access to the Developer Console. Refer to the Pivotal CF Developer Console documentation at [docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) for more information about using the Developer Console.

## <a id='target'></a>Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf tool to target your Elastic Runtime installation. Make sure you have installed the cf tool according to the instructions on [docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com).

1. Open a terminal.
2. Login to your Cloud Controller by targeting 'api' followed by the system domain. Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Configure > Domains** if you do not remember this domain.

 ```
 $ cf target https://api.<your-sys-domain>
 $ cf login admin
 Password> ***********
 ```

  **Note**: Refer to **Elastic Runtime > Credentials** for the UAA admin and password. You can also use the user that you created in the console, or create another user with the create-user command.

3. Switch to the org and space you created in the Developer Console.

  ```
  cf target -o my-awesome-org
  Switching to organization my-awesome-org... OK
  1: development
  2: production
  3: staging
  Space> 1
  Switching to space development... OK

  Target Information (where apps will be pushed):

  CF instance: http://api.<your-sys-domain> (API version: 2)
  user: admin
  target app space: development (org: my-awesome-org)
  ```

4. Switch to the directory of an app you would like to push to Elastic Runtime.

 ```
 $ cd someapp
 ```

5. Push the app to Elastic Runtime.

 ```
 $ cf push someapp
 ```

  Refer to the Pivotal CF documentation for an overview and examples of the cf command line tool.
