title: Getting Started with Pivotal CF
---

Welcome to Pivotal CF!

This guide is intended to walk you through deploying the installation virtual
machine, setting up your PaaS, targeting Elastic Runtime, and pushing your first
app.
If at any time you experience a problem following the steps below, try checking
the Known Issues, or refer to the Troubleshooting Guide for more tips.
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) to learn more about Pivotal CF
and the Pivotal One product suite.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 1: Deploy the Pivotal CF Installation Virtual Machine ##

Download the Pivotal CF .ova file and deploy it using vCenter.
Refer to [Deploying a Pivotal CF Installation Virtual Machine](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/customizing/deploying-vm.html) for
more information.

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 2: Set Up Your PaaS ##

**Goal**: Configure and install VMware vSphere, Elastic Runtime, and MySQL.

1. Browse to the interface IP address you specified in Step 1.

 <%= image_tag("guide/pivotal_cf.png") %>

1. Create a **User name** and **Password** and log in to access the interface.

 **Note**: Save your password in a backed-up location.
If you lose your password, your installation will be unmanageable.

### <a id='select_tiles'></a>Select Products ###

1. Once logged into the Pivotal Operations Manager, click **Add** for Pivotal
Elastic Runtime and Pivotal MySQL Dev.

 <%= image_tag("guide/add_products.png") %>

### <a id='configure_vsphere'></a>Configure VMware vSphere ###

1. Click the **VMware vSphere** tile.

 <%= image_tag("guide/no_vmware_no_er.png") %>

1. In the left column, select **vCenter credentials** if not already selected.

1. Enter your vCenter IP and credentials and click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/vcenter_credentials.png") %>

 **Note**: This user must have create and delete privileges for VMs and folders.

1. Select **vSphere configuration**, specify the installation resources, and
click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/vsphere_configuration.png") %>

1. Select **Network configuration**, enter the Pivotal CF IP ranges, DNS, and
Gateway settings, and click **Save**.
The Pivotal CF VMs will use the IP range you specify.
**Excluded IP Ranges** are blacklisted from the installation.

 <%= image_tag("guide/network_configuration.png") %>

1. Select **NTP servers**, enter a comma-delimited list of time server
addresses, and click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/ntp_servers.png") %>

1. Select **Health Monitor**. This field should be left blank unless you have
installed Pivotal Ops Metrics.
Only set an IP address _after_ you install Pivotal Ops Metrics.

 <%= image_tag("guide/health_monitor.png") %>

1. Select **System Settings**, check or uncheck **Enable VM resurrector
plugin**, and click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/resurrector.png") %>

1. Select **Resource Sizes**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes, and
click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/vsphere_resources.png") %>

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='configure_er'></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

 <%= image_tag("guide/no_er.png") %>

1. In the left column, select **HAProxy** if not already selected.

1. The value you enter in the **HAProxy IPs** field depends on whether you are
using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.

  **Your own load balancer**: Leave this field blank.

  **HAProxy load balancer**: Enter at least one HAProxy IP address. Point your DNS to this address.

  For more information, refer to the Understanding the SSL Termination Options
topic in the Operating Elastic Runtime section of the Pivotal CF docs on
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com). For help understanding the Elastic Runtime architecture, refer to the [Architecture](http://docs.gopivotal.com/pivotalcf/concepts/architecture/) topic in the Elastic Runtime Concepts docs.

 <%= image_tag("guide/haproxy.png") %>

1. SSL certificates: If you are using a signed certificate from a known
certificate authority (CA), input that value in the SSL Certificate fields.
Alternatively, complete the following two steps to generate self-signed RSA
certificates.

1. <a id='generate_rsa_cert'></a>Click **Generate Self-Signed RSA Certificate**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/generate_ssl.png") %>

1. Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format. Optionally, also add
any custom domains, in wildcard format if necessary.
Click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/enter_ssl_domains.png") %>

1. The **Certificate Key PEM** and **Private Key PEM** fields now contain
certificate keys.
Click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/haproxy_ssl.png") %>

1. Select **Cloud Controller**, enter the system and application domains for
your Cloud Controller installation, and click **Save**.
You configured wildcard DNS records for these domains in an earlier step.
  - The system domain is used to target and push apps to Elastic Runtime.
  - The application domain is used to serve apps.

 <%= image_tag("guide/cloud_controller.png") %>

1. Select **Router IPs**.
The value you enter in the **Router IPs** field depends on whether you are
using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.

  **Your own load balancer**: Enter the IP address(es) for Pivotal CF that you registered previously with your load balancer.

  **HAProxy load balancer**: Leave this field blank.

1. Click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/router_ips.png") %>

1. **(Optional--Advanced)** If you are using the VMware SSO appliance for
integration with Active Directory, complete this step.
Select **SAML Login**, enter the URL of an SSO appliance to connect to Active
Directory servers in your organization, and click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/saml_login.png") %>

1. **(Optional)** Select **Web Console**, enter your reply-to and SMTP email
information, and click **Save**.
The console uses these settings to send invitations and confirmations to console
users.
These SMTP settings are required if you want to enable end-user
self-registration.

 **Note**: If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the
administrator will be required to create orgs and users using the cf CLI tool.
Refer to the section on [Creating a New User Account](#new-users) for more
information.

 <%= image_tag("guide/web_console.png") %>

1. Select **Resource Sizes**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes, and
click **Save**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/er_resources.png") %>

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='configure_mysql'></a>Configure mySQL ###

**Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='install'></a>Install Products ###

1. Click **Install**.

 <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated Pivotal CF installation begins deploying.

 <%= image_tag("guide/deploy_progress.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

 **Note**: On the recommended hardware infrastructure, deployment should take
less that one hour and require no user intervention.

You now have a fully functional installation of Pivotal CF and Pivotal MySQL
Service.
The following sections will help you start using your PaaS.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 3: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed Pivotal CF, add users to your account.
Refer to the Using Ops Manager section of the Pivotal CF documentation at
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) for more detailed instructions.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 4: Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf tool to target your Elastic Runtime installation.
Make sure you have installed the cf tool according to the instructions on
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com).
Refer to the Pivotal CF documentation for an overview and examples of the cf
command line tool.

 **Note**: In Pivotal Operations Manager, refer to **Elastic Runtime > Credentials** for the UAA admin and password.
You can also use the user that you created in the console, or create another
user with the create-user command.
