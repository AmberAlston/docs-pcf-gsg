title: Getting Started with Pivotal CF
---

Welcome to Pivotal CF!

This guide is intended to walk you through deploying the installation virtual
machine, setting up your PaaS, targeting Elastic Runtime, and pushing your first
app.
If at any time you experience a problem following the steps below, try checking
the Known Issues, or refer to the Troubleshooting Guide for more tips.
Once you have completed the steps in this guide, explore the documentation on
[docs.gopivotal.com](http://docs.gopivotal.com) to learn more about Pivotal CF
and the Pivotal One product suite.

## <a id='system'></a>Step 1: Confirm System Requirements ##

Before you begin your Pivotal CF deployment, ensure that your system meets the
 minimum requirements. The requirements include capacity for the virtual machines
necessary for the deployment, a supported version of the cf command line interface
tool, and certain user privileges. Refer to the
[Prerequisites](../customizing/requirements.html) topic for the complete list.

## <a id='deploy'></a>Step 2: Deploy Pivotal CF Installation Virtual Machine ##

Download the Pivotal CF .ova file and deploy it using vCenter.
Refer to [Deploying Operations Manager](../customizing/deploying-vm.html) for
more information.

## <a id='paas'></a>Step 3: Set Up Your PaaS ##

**Goal**: Configure and install Ops Manager Director (included), Elastic Runtime,
and Pivotal MySQL Dev. Skip the import steps for Elastic Runtime or Pivotal MySQL
Dev if you do not want to import these products.

1. Browse to the interface IP address you specified in Step 2.

    <%= image_tag("guide/pivotal_cf.png") %>

1. Create a **User name** and **Password** and log in to access the interface.

 **Note**: Save your password in a backed-up location.
If you lose your password, your installation will be unmanageable.

### <a id='import_tiles'></a>Import Products ###

1. Download Elastic Runtime and Pivotal MySQL Dev from [Pivotal Network](https://network.gopivotal.com).

1. From the Available Products view, click **Import a Product** to navigate to the Add Products page.

1. Click **Choose File** and select the Elastic Runtime .zip file that you downloaded from Pivotal Network, then click **Add**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/add-comp-page.png") %>

    After the import completes, Elastic Runtime appears in the Available Products view.

1. Repeat the previous step for Pivotal MySQL Dev.

1. In the Available Products view, hover over Elastic Runtime and click **Add**. Repeat this step for Pivotal MySQL Dev.

<%= image_tag("guide/add_products.png") %>

### <a id='configure_vsphere'></a>Configure Ops Manager Director ###

Your Ops Manager download includes a tile for the version of Ops Manager Director that corresponds to your virtualization system. Refer to one of the following topics for help configuring your Ops Manager Director product tile:

* [Configuring Ops Manager Director for VMware vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html)

### <a id='configure_er'></a>Configure Elastic Runtime ###

1. Click the **Elastic Runtime** tile.

    <%= image_tag("guide/no_er.png") %>

1. In the left column, select **HAProxy** if not already selected.

1. The value you enter in the **HAProxy IPs** field depends on whether you are
using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.

     **Your own load balancer**: Leave this field blank.

     **HAProxy load balancer**: Enter at least one HAProxy IP address. Point your DNS to this address.

     For more information, refer to the [Understanding the SSL Termination Options](../opsguide/ssl-term.html)
topic. For help understanding the Elastic Runtime architecture, refer to the
[Architecture](../concepts/architecture/) topic.

    <%= image_tag("guide/haproxy.png") %>

1. SSL Certificates: If you are using a signed certificate from a known
certificate authority (CA), input that value in the SSL Certificate fields.
Alternatively, complete the following two steps to generate self-signed RSA
certificates.

    1. <a id='generate_rsa_cert'></a>Click **Generate Self-Signed RSA
Certificate**.

        <%= image_tag("guide/generate_ssl.png") %>

    1. Enter your system and app domains in wildcard format. Optionally, also
add any custom domains in wildcard format.
Click **Generate**.

        <%= image_tag("guide/enter_ssl_domains.png") %>

1. The **Certificate Key PEM** and **Private Key PEM** fields now contain
certificate keys.
Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/haproxy_ssl.png") %>

1. Select **Cloud Controller** and enter the system and application domains for
your Cloud Controller installation.
You configured wildcard DNS records for these domains in an earlier step.
  - The system domain is used to target and push apps to Elastic Runtime.
  - The application domain is used to serve apps.

    <%= image_tag("guide/cloud-controller.png") %>

1. **(Optional)** Check the **Disable Custom Buildpacks** checkbox.

    By default, the cf command line tool gives developers the option of using a custom
buildpack when they deploy apps to Elastic Runtime. To do so, they use the `-b` option
to provide a custom buildpack URL with the `cf push` command. The **Disable Custom
Buildpacks** checkbox disables the `-b` option. For more information about custom buildpacks, refer to the
[buildpacks](../buildpacks/) section of the Pivotal CF documentation.

1. Click **Save**.

1. Select **Router IPs**.
The value you enter in the **Router IPs** field depends on whether you are
using your own load balancer or the HAProxy load balancer.

     **Your own load balancer**: Enter the IP address(es) for Pivotal CF that you registered with your load balancer. Refer to the [Using Your Own Load Balancer](../customizing/custom-load-balancer.html) topic for help using your own load balancer with Pivotal CF.

     **HAProxy load balancer**: Leave this field blank.

1. Click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/router_ips.png") %>

1. **(Optional - Advanced)** If you are using the VMware SSO appliance for
integration with Active Directory, complete this step.
Select **SAML Login**, enter the URL of an SSO appliance to connect to Active
Directory servers in your organization, and click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/saml_login.png") %>

1. **(Optional)** Select **Web Console**, enter your reply-to and SMTP email
information, and click **Save**.
The console uses these settings to send invitations and confirmations to console
users.
These SMTP settings are required if you want to enable end-user
self-registration.

    **Note**: If you do not configure the SMTP settings using this form, the
administrator will need to create orgs and users using the cf CLI tool. See [Creating and Managing Users with the cf CLI](../opsguide/cli-user-management.html) for more information.

    <%= image_tag("guide/web_console.png") %>

1. Select **Resource Sizes**, accept the defaults or make necessary changes, and
click **Save**.

    <%= image_tag("guide/er_resources.png") %>

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='configure_mysql'></a>Configure mySQL ###

1. Click the **MySQL Dev** tile.

1. Configure the MySQL resource sizes or keep the default values, then click
**Save**.

1. Click the **Installation Dashboard** link to return to the Installation
Dashboard.

### <a id='install'></a>Install Products ###

1. Click **Install**.

     <%= image_tag("guide/install.png") %>

1. Your updated Pivotal CF installation begins deploying.

     <%= image_tag("guide/deploy_progress.png") %>

1. When the deployment is finished, a success message appears.

     **Note**: On the recommended hardware infrastructure, deployment should take
less that one hour and require no user intervention.

You now have a fully functional installation of Pivotal CF and Pivotal MySQL
Service.
The following sections will help you start using your PaaS.

## <a id='new-users'></a>Step 4: Create New User Accounts ##

Once you have successfully deployed Pivotal CF, add users to your account.
Refer to the [Creating New Elastic Runtime User Accounts](../customizing/creating-account.html) topic for more information.

## <a id='target'></a>Step 5: Target Elastic Runtime ##

The next step is to use the cf tool to target your Elastic Runtime installation.
Make sure you have [installed the cf tool](../devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html).
Refer to the Pivotal CF documentation for more information about [using the cf
command line tool](../devguide/installcf/whats-new-v6.html).

 **Note**: In Pivotal Operations Manager, refer to **Elastic Runtime > Credentials** for the UAA admin and password.
You can also use the user that you created in the console, or create another
user with the create-user command.
