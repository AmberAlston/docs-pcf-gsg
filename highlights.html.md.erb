### <a id='rbac'></a>RBAC Support

Ops Manager 2.0 introduces support for role-based access control (RBAC).
You can assign the **Ops Manager Administrator**, **Full Control**, or **Restricted Control** roles to determine which operators in your organization make deployment changes, view credentials, and manage user roles in Ops Manager.

See [Configuring Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Ops Manager](../opsguide/config-rbac.html) for more information.

### <a id='ssh-banner'></a>Custom Director Login Banner

In Ops Manager 2.0, operators can set a custom banner that every user sees when they log in to the Ops Manager BOSH Director.
To set the banner, edit the **Custom SSH Banner** field in the **Director Config** page of the Ops Manager tile.

See the Director configuration topic for your IaaS for more information.
For example, see [Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#dir-config).

Operators can deploy Ops Manager 2.0 to Microsoft Azure in their own local datacenter using Azure Stack.
