## <a id='om'></a>Ops Manager Highlights

Ops Manager v1.11 includes the following major features:

### <a id='credhub'></a>CredHub Integration

Operators can now configure Ops Manager v1.11 to communicate with VMware NSX. Ops Manager 1.11 supports NSX-V 6.2+. 

This integration makes it easier for operators to define granular firewall access to VMs and apply company networking policies to cloud-native apps. You can use Ops Manager API endpoints to manage the NSX security groups for all your PCF VMs. See [vCenter Config Page](../customizing/vsphere-config.html#vcenter-config) fore more information about the new **NSX Networking** fields in Ops Manager.
