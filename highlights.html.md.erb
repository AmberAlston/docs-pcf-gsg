<html class="list-style-none"></html>

This topic highlights important new features included in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) v1.12.

## <a id='om'></a>Ops Manager Highlights

Ops Manager v1.12 includes the following major features:

### <a id='google-xpn'></a>Google Shared Virtual Private Cloud

Google Shared Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), formerly known as Google Cross-Project Networking (XPN), enables you to assign GCP resources
to individual projects within an organization but allows communication and shared services between projects.
For more information about this feature, see [Configuring a Shared VPC on GCP](../customizing/gcp-shared-vpc.html).

### <a id='credhub-migration'></a>Migrate Non-Configurable Secrets to CredHub

Tile Authors can write a JavaScript migration to move their existing non-configurable secrets into CredHub.
Ops Manager v1.12 supports migrating `secret`, `simple_credential`, and `rsa_pkey_credential` types.
For more information about this feature, see [Migrating Existing Credentials to CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/migrating-credhub-credentials.html)
in the PCF Tile Developers Guide.

### <a id='aws-govcloud'></a>AWS GovCloud (US)

Operators can deploy Ops Manager v1.12 to [AWS GovCloud (US)](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/).
For more information about deploying AWS GovCloud (US), see the following AWS installation topics:

* [Deploying the CloudFormation Template for Pivotal Cloud Foundry on AWS](../customizing/cloudform-template.html)
* [Manually Configuring AWS for PCF](../customizing/pcf-aws-manual-config.html)

### <a id='bosh2'></a>BOSH CLI v2

Ops Manager v1.12.0 uses the new version of the [BOSH CLI](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2.html).
Both versions of the BOSH CLI are installed on the Ops Manager Director VM,
located in `/usr/local/bin/bosh-init` and `/usr/local/bin/bosh2`.
You can use either version of the BOSH CLI to interact with your deployment,
but Pivotal recommends using `bosh2` since the older CLI will be deprecated in
future PCF versions.

In the **Credentials** tab in Ops Manager, click the link to **Bosh2 Commandline Credentials** for a command
that you can copy and paste to log in to the `bosh2` CLI.

For more information about the differences between the old and new versions of the BOSH CLI, see the [BOSH documentation](https://bosh.io/docs/cli-v2-diff.html).

### <a id='commit'></a>Commit GET and DELETE Endpoints

Ops Manager v1.12.0 adds two API endpoints for operators who deploy PCF manually.
If you use Ops Manager to generate manifests that you deploy on your own with BOSH,
the `/commit` endpoint fails when a tile upgrade contains credential variables.

Use the `GET api/v0/staged/products/credhub_credentials` endpoint to retrieve a file
that contains the credentials that you must migrate to CredHub before upgrading a particular tile.

After you migrate the credentials, use `DELETE api/v0/staged/products/credhub_credentials`
to delete the credentials staged in installation.yml.

For more information about this feature, see [Manually Upgrading a Tile that Contains Variable Migrations](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/manual-tile-upgrade.html)
in the Tile Developers Guide.
